                <p>Milksteak is a meal enjoyed by Charlie Kelly. It was first mentioned in the Season 5 episode "The
                    Waitress is Getting Married" where Charlie wants to put it down as his favorite food in an online
                    dating
                    profile. It is later mentioned in the same episode as Charlie orders it in the restaurant.</p>

            <div class="main-content-item main-content2">
                <p>It was mentioned again in the Season 13 episode "Charlie's Home Alone" as one of the brown foods
                    Charlie eats as part of his color rituals to make the Eagles win.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-content-item main-content3">The "milksteak" Charlie refers to is a literal steak boiled in
                milk. He orders it "boiled over hard,
                with a side of your finest Jelly Beans, served raw."</p>
